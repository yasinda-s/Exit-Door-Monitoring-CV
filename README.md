# People Traffic Monitoring Using YOLOv8

This project leverages the power of the YOLOv8 segmentation model and Deep SORT tracking to accurately segment and track people in video streams. Specifically, it focuses on monitoring the incoming and outgoing traffic of individuals near an exit door, making it highly useful for crowd management, security enhancement, and traffic analysis in various settings such as shopping malls, transportation hubs, and public events.

## Features

People Segmentation: Utilizes the advanced capabilities of YOLOv8 for accurate people segmentation in real-time video feeds.
Traffic Tracking: Uses Deep SORT to track the movement of individuals, distinguishing between incoming and outgoing traffic near an exit door.
